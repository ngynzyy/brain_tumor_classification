# Brain Tumor Classification

This project aims to classify brain tumor images into different categories using various machine learning techniques. It includes the implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model using PyTorch, as well as decision tree and XGBoost classifiers from scikit-learn to achieve the best accuracy on the classification task.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of brain tumor images along with their corresponding labels. The dataset is divided into training and testing subsets.

## Results and Evaluation

The performance of each model is evaluated based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The results obtained from the CNN model, decision tree classifier, and XGBoost classifier are compared to determine the best-performing model for brain tumor classification.

## Dependencies

The following dependencies are required to run the code in this project:

- Python `3.9.3`
- PyTorch  `2.0.1`
- scikit-learn `3.1.0`
- XGBoost `1.7.6`
